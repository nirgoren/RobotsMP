Project Tasks
-------------

T4. Fix weird behaviour about the start locations of the robots in Variant1
T5. Understand why G (validMove(robotsX[1], robotsY[1])); doesn't produce expected behaviour but G ((moveXOnly(robotsX[1], robotsY[1]) | moveYOnly(robotsX[1], robotsY[1]))); does
for robot1 in RobotsMPMain (and other variants too) - update: this is due to a confirmed bug in spectra
T6. Improve visuals
T7. Add system variables and interactivity
T8. Figure out dealing with unreachable targets



Delivered in Sprint 1
---------------------

T1. Basic safety guarantees about robot movement
T2. Simulation running (but still not interactive)
T3. Basic safety guarantees about robot movement
