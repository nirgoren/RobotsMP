Assumptions - Changing Goals and Unlabelled variants
-----------

1. The goals can only change if the robots reached their targets
2. The goals can't collide with obstacles
3. All goal locations are unique

Guarantees - Fixed Goals and Changing Goals
----------

1. The robots should get to their targets all at once infinitely often in every run
2. The robots should move in steps of at most 1 in each direction, and only in one direction
3. The robots should not collide with each other or the obstacles
4. The robots should not swap locations with each other

Guarantees - Unlabelled
----------

1. The robots should reach some target all at once infinitely often in every run
2. The robots should move in steps of at most 1 in each direction, and only in one direction
3. The robots should not collide with each other or the obstacles
4. The robots should not swap locations with each other

Guarantees - Limited fuel
----------

1. The robots should get to their targets all at once infinitely often in every run
2. The robots should move in steps of at most 1 in each direction, and only in one direction
3. The robots should not collide with each other or the obstacles
4. The robots should not swap locations with each other
5. Robot i can move at most <fuel[i]> times before reaching its goal (staying in place doesn't count as a move)
6. All Robots stop moving once all robots have reached their goal
