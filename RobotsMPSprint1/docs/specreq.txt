Assumptions
-----------

For now we don't have any environment variables and the start locations, targets and obstacle locations are all hard coded in the specification.

Guarantees
----------

1. The robots should get to their targets all at once infinitely often in every run
2. The robots should move in steps of at most 1 in each direction, and only in one direction
3. The robots should not collide with each other or the obstacles
4. The targets and obstacles locations don't change
